# Introduction #

[Direct Connect (DC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_(file_sharing)) bots are series of DC clients I wrote using Python/SQLite that act as an automated chat bots that provide (usually useful) services to me or other hub users.

# The Bots Are #

  * [The What's New Guy](http://code.google.com/p/dodysw/source/browse/trunk/dcbots/whatsnew_dcbot.py): This guy continuously track users shared files to inform people of new shared files available in network.
  * [The Weather Guy](http://code.google.com/p/dodysw/source/browse/trunk/dcbots/weather_dcbot.py): This guy tells current weather (Canberra) information.
  * [The Nick Tracker Guy](http://code.google.com/p/dodysw/source/browse/trunk/dcbots/nicktracker.py): Like a boss, he completely tracks all users activity including all search request, thus allow bot operator to incriminate what the user has in mind.  A totally privacy-busting guy that can be dangerous--in the wrong hand.
  * [The Did I Am Mentioned Guy](http://code.google.com/p/dodysw/source/browse/trunk/dcbots/iam_mentioned_dcbot.py): Like an attention-deficit teenager, he PM-ed you if your nick name is being gossiped on main chat, thus allows you to crash in the conversation.
  * [The Trivia Wizard](http://code.google.com/p/dodysw/source/browse/trunk/dcbots/trivdcbot.py): Smarter than even a genius, this guy whisper answer on [Trivia DC bot](http://sourceforge.net/projects/triviabotdc/) game, thus provide completely imba and sometimes awkward moment (you cheated!).
  * [The Gamer](http://code.google.com/p/dodysw/source/browse/trunk/gamebot/pyGameDcBot.py): This guy is a game maniac, he collects people that have the interest to play Warcraft 3,Dota, or Counter-strike, tell them current active games, register them self to get PM-ed when a game is created, everything needed to induce game's player critical mass!
