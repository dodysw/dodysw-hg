# Introduction #

Between 2003 and 2004 I wrote an application using Python that added a POP3 interface to [Plasa.com free web mail](http://www.google.com/search?q=plasa+webmail&btnI), so that user can download their mails using a standard POP3 client, and send mails using SMTP client. Later I found that it also worked on some other web mails based on [Communigate Pro](http://www.google.com/search?q=communigate+pro&btnI).

An extension to Popok allows users to download news from detik.com via their POP3 client.
