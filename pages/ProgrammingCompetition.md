Programming competitions are a great not only for their prize and recognition, but to measure your skill against others in the same field. Especially single-fighter coders of small apps that don't usually have the chance to interact with other programmers.

Below are some of the famous online competitions that open 24-hour or on certain periodic times that are available at this time. Only competitions that provide visible ranking/winner are included (e.g. [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) though interesting, doesn't provide visible view of the winners).
