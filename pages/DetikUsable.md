# How it Works #

It worked by way of screen scraping. Later version also provide link-analyzer that targeted for any news site, albeit unoptimized (and some times, simply don't work properly).

It also able to behave as feeders for other instance, in this manner, (usually hidden) gateway instance slurp the content and cache them, while other child instance can rely on the the feeds from gateway and be protected from the event of IP banning.
